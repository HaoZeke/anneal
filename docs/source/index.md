# Anneal: A Python Package for Simulated Annealing

`anneal` is a comprehensive Python package designed to facilitate simulated
annealing and quenching processes across a wide range of applications. Drawing
inspiration from the principles of thermodynamics, `anneal` offers a versatile
suite of tools for optimization tasks, particularly in complex, multidimensional
landscapes where traditional methods falter.

## Key Features

- **Flexible Objective Functions**: Supports both 2D and N-dimensional objective
  functions, including customizable options for specific optimization needs.
- **Advanced Quenching Techniques**: Implements Boltzmann quenching to
  efficiently navigate towards global minima.
- **Modular Design**: Structured to enable easy integration and expansion,
  allowing users to incorporate custom objective functions, cooling schedules,
  and Metropolis-Hastings samplers.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Accompanied by detailed usage examples and a
  theoretical foundation as outlined in the corresponding [ArXiV
  preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02811v2).

## Installation
